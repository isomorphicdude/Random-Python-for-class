# Random-Python-for-class
Just a random place for random codes in Python class

I am a math undergraduate struggling with programming languages but interested in computer science.

This repository will be devoted to the Python course offered at my college but it is not limited to the contents on the curriculum. 

Everyone is welcome to contribute (pronounced help me out)!
